        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a GIS specialist with a strong foundation in spatial analysis, remote sensing, map design, and web mapping applications. I enjoy turning complex geospatial data into clear, visually compelling maps and interactive applications that support land use and planning decisions.

          I’ve collaborated with diverse teams—from planners to designers—to deliver high-quality, data-driven solutions. I’m particularly interested in automating workflows with Python and enhancing user experience through intuitive map interfaces. Whether it’s configuring a dashboard, analyzing LiDAR datasets, or developing custom tools, I’m always looking for ways to blend creativity with technical precision.
